This repo contains the materials that I used to present my in progress work on the paper with contemperaneous title
"Selection of Heterogenous Instruments in Fixed Effect Panel Model" to the econometric reading group at UC Berkeley.

The .pdf presentation is entitled *hsi_presentation.pdf*, the results of my monte carlo exercises are contained in the
jupyter notebook entitled *results_pres.ipynb*, clicking on this file above will open nbviewer but since I have presented
these results with interactive widgets no results will be shown, if you would like to view a live interactive version of
this notebook, click the following button, select results_pres.ipynb from the file structure then shown, then once it open, under "Cells"  select "Run All".
